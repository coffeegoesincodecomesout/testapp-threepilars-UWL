I use this to demonstrate collecting metrics, logs and traces from a testapp in Openshift

1. Ensure the following operators are installed on your cluster:
     Red Hat cluster observability operator
     Red Hat Build of OpenTelemetry
     Red Hat Openshift logging
     Red Hat Loki operator
     Red Hat Tempo operator
     
2. Ensure User workload Monitoring is enabled
